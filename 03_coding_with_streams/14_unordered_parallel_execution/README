This sample demonstrates how to execute a set of tasks in parallel using streams.
In particular, the application will read from a file a list of URLs and will
check if each one of them is accessible.

To install all the dependencies:
  npm install

To run the program (example command line):
  node checkUrls urlList.txt
  
The output will be written in the results.txt file.
