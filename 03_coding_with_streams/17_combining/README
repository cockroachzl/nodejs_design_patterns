This sample demonstrates how to combine multiple streams together.
The sample is split in two parts, one application that compresses and encrypts a file,
another one that decompresses and decrypts a file.

To install all the dependencies:
  npm install

To compress and encrypt a file:
  node archive <password> <path to file>
  
To decompress and dencrypt a file:
  node unarchive <password> <path to file>
