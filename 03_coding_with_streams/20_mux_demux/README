This sample demonstrates how to multiplex and demultiplex streams.
In particular, the program streams the standard output and standard error of a process
to a remote server, using a single TCP connection.

First, run the server:
  node server
  
Then, run the client, providing a Node.js program to launch.
For example to multiplex the stdout and stderr of 'generateData.js',
use the following command:
  node client generateData.js
