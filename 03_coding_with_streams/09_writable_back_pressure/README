This sample demonstrates how to handle the back-pressure coming from a Writable stream.
The HTTP server implemented in the sample, produces a random sequence 
of strings trying to overload the socket causing the back-pressure to kick in.

You must first install the dependencies:
  npm install
  
Then to run the program:
  node entropyServer
  
Connect to the server with a Browser or curl:
  curl localhost:8080
