This sample demonstrates how to write data into a Writable stream.
It starts an HTTP server that writes a random sequence of strings inside
the response stream.

You must first install the dependencies:
  npm install
  
Then to run the program:
  node entropyServer
  
Connect to the server with a browser or curl:
  curl localhost:8080
