First, make sure to install the dependencies:
  npm install
  
Then make sure you have browserify installed globally on your machine:
  npm install -g browserify

Then create a client bundle with:
  browserify client/index.js -o www/bundle.js
  
Next, start the server:
  node app
  
Now, to open the application, navigate with a browser to the 
following address:
  http://localhost:8080
